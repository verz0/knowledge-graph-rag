# Knowledge Graph Travel Recommendation System
This project implements a travel recommendation system that leverages a knowledge graph to provide users with enriched information about popular places.

## Features
City and Place Lookup:

- Verifies user-specified destination city existence within the knowledge graph.
- Retrieves popular places from the Google Maps API for the chosen city.

## Knowledge Graph Enrichment:

- For each retrieved place, the system queries the knowledge graph to discover related entities within 3 hops.
- This provides richer context about points of interest, such as historical significance, nearby attractions, or cultural aspects.

## Sentence Generation (Placeholder):

- The system currently builds basic sentences describing the first relationship found in the knowledge graph for each place.
- Future updates will incorporate more complex sentence generation based on retrieved relationships and properties.

## Future Development
- User Preference Integration:
- Implement functionality to capture user preferences (e.g., historical interests, outdoor activities, culinary experiences).

## GPT Recommendation Generation:

- Use a pre-trained language model (GPT) to create a descriptive JSON list of recommended places based on user preferences and enriched information.

# Selection Handling:

Integrate a feature to allow users to specify their interests from the list of enriched places.
Update the recommended places list based on user selections.
Error Handling and Scalability:

Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls and knowledge graph queries.
Optimize Cypher queries and result processing for improved performance with larger knowledge graphs.
